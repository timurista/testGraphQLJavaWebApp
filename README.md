### Overview

The implementation is based on Spring boot starter web project that will expose the GraphQL endpoint as rest controller.

It takes care of exposing a rest endpoint with all configured graphQL fields automatically.

The library aims for real-life usage in production with the ease of Spring Boot.


### Getting started

Check out the following documentation on [using spring boot starter](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter) project.

By adding GraphQL Spring boot starter as maven dependency on the application a @Controller will be created pointing to the configured request mapping with default "/v1/graphql".
During startup all components that implement "GraphQlFields" interface will be applied on the GraphQL schema exposed by the controller.

An example from the sample project:
```java
package com.merapar.graphql.sample.fields;

import com.merapar.graphql.GraphQlFields;
import graphql.schema.GraphQLFieldDefinition;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import static graphql.Scalars.GraphQLString;
import static graphql.schema.GraphQLFieldDefinition.newFieldDefinition;

@Component
public class HelloWorldFields implements GraphQlFields {

    @Override
    public List<GraphQLFieldDefinition> getQueryFields() {
        return Collections.singletonList(
                newFieldDefinition()
                        .type(GraphQLString)
                        .name("hello")
                        .staticValue("world")
                        .build()
        );
    }

    @Override
    public List<GraphQLFieldDefinition> getMutationFields() {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
}
```


#### Configuration

The following default properties can be configured via properties file:

```yaml
com.merapar.graphql:
  rootQueryName: "queries"
  rootQueryDescription: ""
  rootMutationName: "mutations"
  rootMutationDescription: ""
  requestMapping:
    path: "/v1/graphql"
  executor:
    minimumThreadPoolSizeQuery: 10
    maximumThreadPoolSizeQuery: 20
    keepAliveTimeInSecondsQuery: 30
    minimumThreadPoolSizeMutation: 10
    maximumThreadPoolSizeMutation: 20
    keepAliveTimeInSecondsMutation: 30
    minimumThreadPoolSizeSubscription: 10
    maximumThreadPoolSizeSubscription: 20
    keepAliveTimeInSecondsSubscription: 30
    
```
